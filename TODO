These are some open issues, in arbitrary order:
* Use hardware timer registers instead of interrupt driven timer.
* Have _sbrk also check for stack collision.
* Make baudrates programmable
* Implement CAN2B and RTR
* Write a configuration script to setup Makefiles.
* Expand Makefile to build examples.
