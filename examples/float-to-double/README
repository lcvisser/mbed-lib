Single-precision floating point support seems to be a bit broken, either due to a bug in gcc/newlib or due to a bug in the Cortex-M3. Either way, since double-precision floating point support appears to be working fine, this small example shows how to convert from single precision floating point to double precision floating point.
Consult documentation on the IEEE 754-1985 standard for more information.
