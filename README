MBED-LIB
--------
The project website is at

http://code.google.com/p/mbed-lib

The mbed-lib package provides open source development libraries for the mbed (http://mbed.org). The library also includes the LPC17xx CMSIS Library interface provided by NXP.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
You can download the binaries and source from

http://code.google.com/p/mbed-lib/

You need a gcc based toolchain for the ARM processors. I recommend the toolchain build provided by James Snyder (https://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain).


USAGE
-----
Running `make' builds both libmbed.

The build targets are:
* all
* mbed-lib
* mbed-examples
* mbed-doc
* clean
They pretty much do what you'd expect them to.


DISCLAIMER
----------
The LPC17xx CMSIS code is provided by NXP. I made a few small changes, which can be found in lpc17xx/patches.

The mbed library was started as an attempt to organize myself when writing code for the mbed. There are no warranties or guarantees whatsoever. If you find a bug, I would appreciate if you report this on the project website.
