MBED-LIB
--------
The project website is at

http://code.google.com/p/mbed-lib

The mbed-lib package provides development libraries for the mbed (http://mbed.org). There are two libraries:
* libmbed is a custom library designed to easily interface the hardware on the mbed board.
* liblpc17xx is compiled from the CMSIS source code files provided by ARM.
Both are needed in order to build binaries for the mbed.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
You can downlaod the binaries and source from

http://code.google.com/p/mbed-lib/

You need a gcc based toolchain for the ARM processors. I recommend the toolchain build provided by James Snyder (https://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain).


USAGE
-----
Running `make' builds both libmbed and liblpc17xx. Before doing so, you may need to change the Makefile a bit to indicate where the source files are to be found. By default, it assumed that the CMSIS sources are found in ./lpc17xx and the mbed sources in ./mbed. If you downloaded the archive files from the project website, or if you checked out the entire source tree, everything should work right away.

The build targets `lpc17xx', `mbed', `clean', `clean-lpc17xx' and `clean-mbed' do exactly what you think they do.


DISCLAIMER
----------
I did not write the code for the CMSIS library. This code was written by ARM, and they hold the copyright to this code. I made a few small modifications, which are listed in lpc17xx/README and on the project website.

The mbed library  was started as an attempt to organize myself when writing code for the mbed. There are no warranties or guarantees whatsoever. If you find a bug, I would appreciate if report this on the project website.
